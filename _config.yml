about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I have been a research software engineer for many years in academic institutions and industry.
  That means I bring state-of-the-art technology from <mark>Natural Language Processing</mark>, Machine Learning, and <mark>Deep Learning</mark>
  to practical use.

  - Defining problems and possible solutions in close communication
  - Agile development approach
  - Advanced <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> solutions, scientifically grounded
  - Software development by hightest quality standards
  - Cloud and system engineering (AWS, Linux etc.), open-source software
  - Inter-disciplinary research and technology development

  I have been consulting progressive projects such as the [Center for the Advancement of Infrastructural Imagination (CAII)](https://infra-imagination.org/) and [The Syllabus](https://www.the-syllabus.com/).
  I'm always interested in discussing other ideas and projects around information retrieval and search, language and linguistics, knowledge and information, and artificial intelligence!

          Academic research, powered by pioneering software
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As part of the national research infrastructure, The Netherlands eScience Center builds and applies software to enhance the use of computing and digital technologies in academic research.
          As a member of the Social Sciences & Humanities section, I focus on software development that facilitates the use of state-of-the-art technology for research projects in those disciplines.
          
          I am currently the lead engineer of these research projects:
            - [The Semantics of Sustainability](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/the-semantics-of-sustainability):
            development and application of <mark>large language models (LLMs)</mark>, incorporating temporal information
            - [Leveraging AI for HTR post-correction](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/lahter):
            development and application of NLP and machine learning for improving digitized handwritten texts , within the [Globalise project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl/).

          I also teach the [Introduction to Deep Learning course](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/deep-learning-intro/).
