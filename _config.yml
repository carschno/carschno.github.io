about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I have been a research software engineer for many years in academic institutions and industry.
  That means I bring state-of-the-art technology from <mark>Natural Language Processing</mark>, Machine Learning, and <mark>Deep Learning</mark>
  to practical use.
  This implies developing software by highest standards, tailored to the needs of users and other stakeholders,
  including requirements analysis, implementation, and deployment.

  - Defining problems and possible solutions in close communication
  - Agile development approach
  - Advanced <mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> solutions, scientifically grounded
  - Build what is needed, re-use what exists
  - Cloud and system engineering (AWS, Linux etc.), open-source software.
